This network was a test of a new fitness function that runs the maximum number of trials for each member of the population and returns the percentage wins as a fitness value.

The evolutionary algorithm was run on a checkers game that ends after 32 moves, with a population size of 50, 100 generations, 128 games played per trial, and a 4 maximum streak to return.

The network failed to converge on 100%.
