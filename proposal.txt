Neuroevolution in Go
Project Proposal

My project for CS-344 will be to implement a neuroevolution algorithm in golang. I intend to compare neuroevolution solutions to common game playing problems with more traditional search based algorithms and to compare the results of neuroevolution for multiple different games.

So far, I have working Go code that can solve a simple implementation of tic-tac-toe in a reasonable amount of time. I intend to implement either Connect-Four or Othello, and if time allows, attempt to have the algorithm play Go. (That is Go the game, not Go the language)

Neuroevolution is an appropriate algorithm for the course because it combines techniques from supervised learning (neural networks) with search algorithms. (genetic algorithms)
